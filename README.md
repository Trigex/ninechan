Text Board script

This is some thing I quickly threw together... then decided to continue working on and now is a fully featured BBS script

Requires a PHP version that supports regular mysql, I recommend PHP 5.4.

Live demo: http://nine.flashii.net/ (/dev/ is the live development board. In other words; expect it to be broken every now and then)

PHP requirement change for 1.9
===========================

You need at least PHP 5.3 with MySQLi support
